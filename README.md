A simple encrypted salary demo

## Introduction
We design an smart contract for paying salary, in order to achieve the fairness and eradicate unreasonable refusal/delay. Moreover we plan to hide the actual amount of each agent's balance/salary except for herself and trusted party (say, the boss or the board of directors). Since all on-chain data can be analyzed by locally hacking the EVM, the secrets need to be cryptographically encrypted.
